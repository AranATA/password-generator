## description

***

This is an assignment to modify a starter code and create a password generator in Java Script. The UI enables employees to<br>
generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS<br>
powered by JavaScript code that adapts to multiple screen sizes.<br>
This work was completed by using HTML, CSS and JS coding. Best viewed at full screen, 16:10 aspect ratio.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I need a new, secure password:<br>
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password; THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br>
* WHEN prompted for password criteria; THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br>
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password; THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than<br>
128 characters
* WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password; THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt; THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered; THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated; THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## some valuable references

***

These notes and links are listing some valuable references among others that I used doing this project:<br>
<br>

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9719570/generate-random-password-string-with-requirements-in-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9719570/generate-random-password-string-with-requirements-in-javascript)

A warning from Steve Sokolowski from a posting at the link above:<br>
* Any password generated with Math.random() is EXTREMELY BAD.
This function uses the system time as a seed for the<br>
random number generator. Anyone who knows the time the password was generated can easily brute-force the<br>
password. In almost all cases, this data is easily available - just take the registration_time column in a hacked database,<br>
and test out all the values generated by the Math.random() algorithm using the times from 15 to 0 minutes before.<br>
A password generated with Math.random() is completely worthless because the time the password was first used is<br>
enough for cracking it.
