## description

***

This is an assignment to modify a starter code and create a password generator in Java Script. The UI enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that adapts to multiple screen sizes.<br>
This work was completed by using HTML, CSS and JS coding. Best viewed at full screen, 16:10 aspect ratio.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I need a new, secure password:
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password; THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria; THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password; THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password; THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt; THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered; THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated; THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
